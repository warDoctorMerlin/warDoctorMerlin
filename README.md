- 👋 Hi, I’m @warDoctorMerlin
- 👀 I’m interested in encryption, in particular the classical and mechanical ciphers like Vigenere and Enigma, because it just fascinates me how complex the algorithms that
encrypt data are, and I enjoy working out how they work and even better programming it in various different languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a better programmer through doing various challenges, and reading books on Python and Java, the languages that I am confident in. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects that are relevant to real life problems.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email hagenmcg@hotmail.com
